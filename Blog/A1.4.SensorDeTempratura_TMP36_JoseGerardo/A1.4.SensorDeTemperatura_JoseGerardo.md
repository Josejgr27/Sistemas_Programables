3. Calculate, measure and record the values requested for Vout1, under the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

| Number | Condition | Vout1 measured voltage | Voltage measured at R1 | Indicated temperature |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1      | Minimum   | .0999V | 11mV | -40°C |
| 2      | Medium     | .929V | 11mV | 43°C |
| 3      | Maximum    | 1.75V | 11mV | 125°C |


Temperature = (Vout - 0.5) * 100

Substituting 

Minimum = (.0999V - 0.5) * 100 = -40.01°C 

Medium = (.929V - 0.5) * 100 = 42.9°C 

Maximum = (1.75V - 0.5) * 100 = 125°C


4. Using the image of the TMP36 transistor corresponding to stage 1, connect the Vout1 terminal to the non-investment terminal of the LM741, and assemble the circuit corresponding to stage 2.

5. **What value should R3 have in the Stage 2 circuit, to achieve Vout2 = 3.3 volts,** for the maximum temperature condition that the sensor is able to detect? As you can see the resistance R3 corresponds to a potentiometer, however resistance arrangements can be made to achieve a fine fit. Why do you think a **3.3 output voltage** is being requested?

To calculate this, first we need to use the Vout formula for an OpAmp:

![](https://github.com/Mauricio-Navarro/Joserma/blob/main/A1.4%20Sensor%20Temperatura%20TMP36/formula_opamp.PNG)

using said formula, we get the formula to calculate R2 (in this case R2 is equals to R3, the resistance value we're looking for)

![](https://github.com/Mauricio-Navarro/Joserma/blob/main/A1.4%20Sensor%20Temperatura%20TMP36/formula_despejada.PNG)

We substitute the values

![](https://github.com/Mauricio-Navarro/Joserma/blob/main/A1.4%20Sensor%20Temperatura%20TMP36/resultado_r2.PNG)

**Why do you think a 3.3 output voltage is being requested?**

Because 3.3 volts is an standard among microcontrollers and boards such as the ESP32 or the Arduino family, also the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. And since the purpose of using this sensor is reading its data and these systems are used to read data from sensors, it makes sense to adjust the maximum value to 3.3V.

Setting 3.3V as the threshold also makes possible an analogic to digital conversion: where values below 3.3V will be taken as a digital 0 and if the sensor reaches its maximum temperature, a 3.3V will be in the output, meaning a digital 1.

6. Once the value R3 has been adjusted leave it there and record the values requested for Vout2, for the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

| Number | Condition | Voltage measured at R2 | Vout2 measured voltage | Indicated temperature |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1 | Minimum | 99.8mV | 188mV | -40 C |
| 2 | Medium | 918mV | 1.73 V | 42 C |
| 3 | Maximum | 1.75 | 3.3V | 125 C |

Conclusions of each team member

### Edgar Regalado

At first i thought we wouldn't use the opamp again, but after this practice i think that the opamp integrated circuit is very useful. Being able to adjust the voltage of a sensor to higher voltages is good because sometimes the voltage output of a sensor might be just too small to make something out of it, and just as mentioned in the 5th section, being able to convert values to 3.3v can be used as a way to convert analog signals into digital ones, which proves useful if we want to know wheter a condition is met or not without having to use software code

### Mauricio Navarro

With the development of this practice, the objective of knowing a little more about the use and application of the TMP36 transistor in collaboration with the LM741 operational amplifier is fulfilled.
It is possible to appreciate how with the TMP36 temperature sensor it delivers the information of the ambient temperature through the voltage on its signal pin causing the measured voltage to change, in the same way it is appreciated how the operational amplifier increased to the sensor signal of temperature causing the measured voltage to increase.  

### Erick García

While doing this practice, it was interesting to notice that TMP36 prety crealy; p rovides a voltage output that is linearly proportional to Celsius temperature, also that adjusting the voltage it is a great idea for different outputs on maybe different proyects.

### Jose Gerardo

In this practice I learned that using a temperature sensor, which could provide ranges of values from 0.0999V to 1.75V depending on the temperature, the precision can be increased by using a conditioner, increasing the range of values from 0.304V to 4.5V, this being an integrated circuit normally carried by arduino sensor modules
